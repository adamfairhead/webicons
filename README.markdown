# Webicons

Webicons is a set of resolution-independent social icons for use on your website. They use feature-detected SVG graphics (with PNG fallbacks) to display the icons over their appropriate negatively indented anchor titles.

If you have icon suggestions, check the issue queue for "Icon Suggestions".

Enjoy Webicons!
